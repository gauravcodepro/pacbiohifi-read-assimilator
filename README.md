# pacbiohifi-read-assimilator
a pacbiohifi read check for the quick view of the read types and making it easy for the fasta manipulations and read extractions. A much faster pacbiohifi read assimilator which converts the pacbiohifi reads to the fasta and the corrresponding extractions for the assembler. It also writes the pacbiohifi reads indivually so that you can remove certain reads of not interest.
